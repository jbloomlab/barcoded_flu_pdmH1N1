  description: Single-cell transcriptomics using the wildtype and dblySyn viral
               tag variants at a low MOI. Infection volume was chosen based on the results
               of `hashing_trial1` and flow cytometry. The incolum volume for
               the wildtype tag variant was about 12-fold higher, and for the
               dblSyn tag variant was about 24-fold higher.
