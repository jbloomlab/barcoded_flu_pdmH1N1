# flu sequences
This subdirectory has the flu sequences used in the experiments.

The [./plasmid_maps](plasmid_maps) subdirectory has the Genbank files for the Bloom lab plasmid maps for the plasmids used to generate the viruses.

The Python script [make_seqs_and_gtf.py](make_seqs_and_gtf.py) takes these plasmid maps and constructs files with the sequences and annotations for the rest of the analysis.
