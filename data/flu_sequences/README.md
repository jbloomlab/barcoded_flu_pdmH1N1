# flu sequences

This subdirectory has the flu sequences used in the experiments.
There are separate files for the wildtype and double-synonymously tagged variants of the A/California/4/2009 (H1N1) virus, abbreviated "CA09".
The directory contains:

 - FASTA files with the full vRNAs: [flu-CA09.fasta](flu-CA09.fasta) and [flu-CA09-dblSyn.fasta](flu-CA09-dblSyn.fasta)

 - GTF files annotating these full vRNA FASTA files: [flu-CA09.gtf](flu-CA09.gtf) and [flu-CA09-dblSyn.gtf](flu-CA09-dblSyn.gtf).

 - Genbank files for the full vRNAs: [flu-CA09.gb](flu-CA09.gb) and [flu-CA09-dblSyn.gb](flu-CA09-dblSyn.gb).

 - FASTA files with the viral mRNAs: [flu-CA09-mRNA.fasta](flu-CA09-mRNA.fasta) and [flu-CA09-dblSyn-mRNA.fasta](flu-CA09-dblSyn-mRNA.fasta).

These files are automatically generated from the Bloom lab plasmid maps in [./plasmid_maps](plasmid_maps), which give the sequences of the plasmids used to create teh viruses by reverse genetics.
The plasmid maps that create the files are generated by the Python script [make_seqs_and_gtf.py](make_seqs_and_gtf.py), which you can run with simply:

    python make_seqs_and_gtf.py

## Notes

### Upstream start codon in NP segment
The vRNA for the NP from CA09 contains an upstream translation-initiation site that adds a 6 amino-acid N-terminal extension to the protein, increasing its length from 498 to 504 residues.
Based on the results described in [Wise et al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2019/09/04/738427) (which are admittedly for a slightly different viral strain), it appears that the upstream start is less used than the canonical one, so we have annotated the NP CDS using the canonical start codon to give a 498-residue rather than a 504-residue protein.

### Barcoded Segments
The plasmid maps for the barcoded segments (with `'bc'` in their Genbank file names) have some differences from the rest of the plasmids. First, these segments are carried on a pHH, rather pHW backbone. Second, these segments have a duplicated packaging signal at the 5' and 3' end of the coding sequence. Third, these segments have a 16N viral barcode inserted between the end of the coding sequence and the duplicated packaging signal.

Briefly, these plasmids were produced by amplifying the coding sequence from plasmids `2232 (HA_G155E)`, `2303 (HA_G155E-dblSyn)`, `368 (NA)`, or `2304 (NA-dblSyn)` with a primer that appends a 16N barcode to the 3' end of the CDS. They were then cloned into a backbone with an appropriate duplicated packaging signal: `2227 (HA)` or `2228 (NA)`. For complete details on generating the barcoded plasmid libraries for these segments, see David Bacsik's notebook entries: [Cloning Barcoded CA09 HA and NA](https://benchling.com/s/etr-rkHAIdbirA7Qo3WrTvN9).
