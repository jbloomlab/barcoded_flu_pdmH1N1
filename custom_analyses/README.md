### Barcode sharing troubleshooting
This analysis uses data from the scProgenyProduction experiments. It looks at barcodes that are found in both the `WT` and `syn` tag data for the progeny viral barcodes. It contains plots that illustrate the viral barcode sharing. It also checks to see if each barcode is present in the rescued viral stock for that sample.
