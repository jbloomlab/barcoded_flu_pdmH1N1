## An interactive plot
### Viral transcription and progeny production
This page provides an interactive version of figure 5A from XXX. Each point on this plot represents a single-influenza infected cell. You can mouse over each point to see information about the outcomes of viral infection in that cell. At the bottom of the plot, there are drop down menus to select cells with specific viral genotypes and missing viral genes.

### Data available on this plot
This plot shows viral transcription on the x-axis and progeny production on the y-axis. Each point represents a single influenza-infected cell. Mousing over a point provides further information:  

`cell_barcode`: Barcode that uniquely identifies each cell  
`frac_viral_UMIs`: Fraction of mRNA in the cell from frac_viral_UMIs  
`total_UMIs`: Total number of unique mRNA molecules sequenced in the cell  
`missing_viral_genes`: List of viral genes that are *not* expressed in the cell  
`mutated_genes`: List of viral genes that have any mutation  
`freq_supernatant`: Fraction of viral barcodes generated by cell in supernatant; represents physical progeny virions
`freq_second_infection`:  Fraction of viral barcodes generated by cell in cells infected with supernatant ; represents infectious progeny virions
`viral_mutations`: List of mutations identified in the viral genes and classification of the mutation (e.g. synonymous, non-synonymous, non-coding)
`mutation_support`: Number of UMIs sequenced in the PacBio data supporting a consensus mutation out of all UMIs sequenced in the PacBio data for gene

### How this plot was created
This plot shows the total viral transcription and progeny produced by single influenza-infected cells. Total viral transcription was calculated as the fraction of mRNA from virus in each cell. Physical progeny production (left) was calculated as the fraction of viral barcodes in the supernatant associated with each cell among barcodes assignable to any infected cell. Infectious progeny production (right) was calculated in the same way, using RNA extracted from cells infected with progeny viral supernatants.
