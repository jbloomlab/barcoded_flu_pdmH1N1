    "# Call consensus sequences for viral barcodes in each cell\n",
    "This Python Jupyter notebook corrects/calls consensus viral barcodes in each cell. Viral barcodes are input as UMI count data, assigned to a cell barcode and gene. The notebook uses UMI tools to correct the viral barcodes for each cell; this provides a set of consensus viral barcodes within each cell. The notebook outputs the corrected viral barcode counts and a whitelist of viral barcodes identified on each segment.\n",
