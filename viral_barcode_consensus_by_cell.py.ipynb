    "# Call consensus sequences for viral barcodes in each cell\n",
    "This Python Jupyter notebook corrects/calls consensus viral barcodes in each cell. Viral barcodes are input as UMI count data, assigned to a cell barcode and gene. The notebook uses UMI tools to correct the viral barcodes for each cell; this provides a set of consensus viral barcodes within each cell. The notebo as well as a whitelist of all viral barcodes identified on each segment for each tag.\n",

    "* Using directional adjacency method. This has [been demonstrated on simulated data](https://cgatoxford.wordpress.com/2015/08/14/unique-molecular-identifiers-the-problem-the-solution-and-the-proof/) to produce a more accurate estimate of true UMI number than other heuristics.\n",
